# IN DEV

## CAL-2 Make placed overlays called at individual Panel level

Right now the overlays from a placed piece are called only at the panel where the cell is placed - change this to be from each covered panel

# Backlog

## CAL-? Make clicking a piece with placed overlay select that piece

Desc

---

## Story - Add rotations - clicking the selected cell should rotate the piece

Desc

#### Consider how a piece will be FLIPPED over (mirrored)

8 ROTATIONS! 0,0 -> 0,1 -> 0,2 -> 0,3 -> 1,0 -> 1,1 -> 1,2 -> 1,3 -> 0,0 ...

With reduced cycles for things that don't go that far so that positions <-> placements are bijective

# DONE
